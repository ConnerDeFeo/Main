Focus on what is currently required to support <strong>Sprint 1 - Demo requirements</strong>. Make sure to describe your design choices in the corresponding <em><strong>Tier Section</strong></em> and also in the <em><strong>OO Design Principles</strong></em> section below.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="ArchitectureDiagram.png" alt="The Tiers &amp; Layers of the Architecture"></p>
<p>The web application, is built using the Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern.</p>
<p>The Model stores the application data objects including any functionality to provide persistance.</p>
<p>The View is the client-side SPA built with Angular utilizing HTML, CSS and TypeScript. The ViewModel provides RESTful APIs to the client (View) as well as any logic required to manipulate the data objects from the Model.</p>
<p>Both the ViewModel and Model are built using Java and Spring Framework. Details of the components within these tiers are supplied below.</p>
<h3 id="overview-of-user-interface">Overview of User Interface</h3>
<p>This section describes the web interface flow; this is how the user views and interacts with the web application.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="view-tier">View Tier</h3>

<p><em><strong>[Sprint 4]</strong> Provide a summary of the View Tier UI of your architecture.
Describe the types of components in the tier and describe their
responsibilities.  This should be a narrative description, i.e. it has
a flow or &quot;story line&quot; that the reader can follow.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>[Sprint 4]</strong> You must  provide at least <strong>2 sequence diagrams</strong> as is relevant to a particular aspects
of the design that you are describing.  (<strong>For example</strong>, in a shopping experience application you might create a
sequence diagram of a customer searching for an item and adding to their cart.)
As these can span multiple tiers, be sure to include an relevant HTTP requests from the client-side to the server-side
to help illustrate the end-to-end flow.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>[Sprint 4]</strong> To adequately show your system, you will need to present the <strong>class diagrams</strong> where relevant in your design. Some additional tips:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Class diagrams only apply to the <strong>ViewModel</strong> and <strong>Model</strong> Tier</em></li>
<li><em>A single class diagram of the entire system will not be effective. You may start with one, but will be need to break it down into smaller sections to account for requirements of each of the Tier static models below.</em></li>
<li><em>Correct labeling of relationships with proper notation for the relationship type, multiplicities, and navigation information will be important.</em></li>
<li><em>Include other details such as attributes and method signatures that you think are needed to support the level of detail in your discussion.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="oo-design-principles">OO Design Principles</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>[Sprint 1]</strong> Name and describe the initial OO Principles that your team has considered in support of your design (and implementation) for this first Sprint.</em>
Open/Closed
BMD is incorporating the Open/Closed principle in our design by planning for all classes to be extendable, but not extensively changed in their functionality. For example, the needFileDAO class implements the NeedDAO class, and the NeedDAO class is used via other functions so that NeedFileDAO has some private and untouchable characteristics. We could still improve in this area by making some sort of extendable basket, so that wishlist and afunding basket could both polymorph from it in order to keep more efficient code.

<img src="OOD_pics/NeedDAO.PNG" alt="NeedDAO">
<img src="OOD_pics/NeedFileDAO.PNG" alt="NeedFileDAO"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Single Responsibility
BMD is incorporating the Single Responsibility principle in our design by having each class be focused in its use. For example, the NeedController class’s purpose is to handle API requests and respond with HTTP Codes. It does not manage Need data and its storage. Instead, this job is outsourced to the NeedFileDAO class. Our usage of the single responsible principle could be further improved by consistent checking whenever a class is created that it only has one responsibility and by using the same framework with Basket and Cupboard as with Need.

<img src="OOD_pics/NeedFileDAO_createNeed().PNG" alt="NeedFileDAO createNeed()">
<img src="OOD_pics/NeedFileDAO_save().PNG" alt="NeedFileDAO save()"></p>
<p>Dependency Inversion/Injections
This principle will be designed in our design in a variety of ways. We will design our system to follow the Dependency Inversion principle by ensuring that high-level modules do not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both will depend on abstractions. Here is a list of all examples of this from our current project:
For example, funding Baskets will be created separately from the user. I.E, the user will not be the one to instantiate or create a new funding baskets when they want to, that will be the job of the application to create one then inject the funding basket into the user’s current list of funding baskets
To further improve adherence to Dependency Inversion, we could ensure that all dependencies are handled through interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete implementations. This would allow us to easily swap out implementations in the future without impacting the high-level code
<img src="OOD_pics/Application_Injecting_Funding_Basket.PNG" alt="Funding Basket Injection"></p>
<p>Law of Demeter
This principle will be implemented by BMD in a variety of ways. The obvious cases we have endevoured upon so far have been in regards to our backend chaining of fundciotions via dot notation. For instance, funding basket will call a give user then through that user add a need, and not simply add a need directly to the users funding basket. out code isnt perfect, adn we still have areas we could improve, and we could further enhance out LoD by making our controllers specifically more independant and only talk to their &quot;neighbors&quot;

<p><em><strong>[Sprint 2, 3 &amp; 4]</strong> Will eventually address upto <strong>4 key OO Principles</strong> in your final design. Follow guidance in augmenting those completed in previous Sprints as indicated to you by instructor. Be sure to include any diagrams (or clearly refer to ones elsewhere in your Tier sections above) to support your claims.</em></p>
